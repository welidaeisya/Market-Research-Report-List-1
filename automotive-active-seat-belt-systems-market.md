<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Seat Belt Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emergency Locking Retractor</li><li>Automatic Locking Retractor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive active seat belt systems market includes two main types: Emergency Locking Retractors (ELR) and Automatic Locking Retractors (ALR). ELRs engage during sudden stops or accidents, locking the belt to secure the occupant, while allowing for normal movement under regular conditions. In contrast, ALRs automatically lock the belt when pulled out, providing a fixed restraint for child seats or when needed. Both systems enhance passenger safety by ensuring effective restraint during dynamic driving situations and potential collisions.</p></p>
