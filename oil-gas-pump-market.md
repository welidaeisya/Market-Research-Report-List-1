<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil & Gas Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oil & Gas Pump market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for high flow rates and low-viscosity liquids. They are commonly used in upstream and downstream applications. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, move fluids by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it into the discharge pipe, providing consistent flow regardless of pressure changes. They are essential in applications requiring high viscosity handling and precise flow rates.</p></p>
