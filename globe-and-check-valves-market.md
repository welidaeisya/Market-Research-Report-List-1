<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Globe and Check Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Globe Valves</li><li>Check Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The globe and check valves market includes two primary types: globe valves and check valves. Globe valves are designed for regulating flow in a piping system, using a spherical disc that controls the passage of fluid. They excel in throttling applications and offer good sealing capabilities. In contrast, check valves allow fluid to flow in one direction only, preventing backflow and protecting systems from potential damage. Both valve types are essential in industries like oil and gas, water management, and HVAC systems.</p></p>
