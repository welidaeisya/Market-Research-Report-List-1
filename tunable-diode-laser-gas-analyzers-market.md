<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunable Diode Laser Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunable diode laser gas analyzers are classified into two primary market types: in-situ and extractive. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentrations directly within the process environment, offering real-time data without needing sample extraction. This method is often favored for its rapid response and minimal disturbance to the process. Conversely, extractive analyzers collect gas samples from the environment and analyze them separately, allowing for more comprehensive analysis and calibration but introducing potential delays and complexity in sample handling.</p></p>
