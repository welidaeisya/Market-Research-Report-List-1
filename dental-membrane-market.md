<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Dental Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Dental Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental membrane market is primarily divided into two types: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable dental membranes are designed to be absorbed by the body over time, promoting tissue regeneration while eliminating the need for surgical removal. Non-resorbable membranes, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not dissolve and require surgical removal after healing. Both types play critical roles in dental procedures, such as guided bone regeneration and periodontal surgery, by supporting tissue healing and growth.</p></p>
